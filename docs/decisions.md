# Decisions Log

Claude Code: append here whenever you make an architectural call mid-build.
Keep entries short — decision + one-line why. Newest at bottom.

**2026-08-13 — Movement split into two systems.** Drag-steering (world layer, no
path planning, axis-separated obstacle sliding) is separate from waypoint/BFS pathing
(need-bubble auto-walk only). Mixing them caused stutter in the Phase 0 spike
(path recomputed every pointer-move, fighting mid-step position).

**2026-08-13 — Art fallback pattern confirmed.** Objects/sprites check for a real
asset file first (e.g. `sprite.png`), silently fall back to code-drawn placeholder
if missing. Validated in Phase 0 spike; carries into Phase 1 as a hard requirement,
not a nice-to-have.

**2026-08-13 — Tile size ~25cm, provisional.** Held up at Phase 0 spike scale (single
mocked-up living room). Not yet validated against real measured room dimensions or
the new camera-follow zoom level (R1). Re-measure before finalizing room files.
