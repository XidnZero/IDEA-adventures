# Decisions Log

Claude Code: append here whenever you make an architectural call mid-build.
Keep entries short — decision + one-line why. Newest at bottom.

**2026-08-13 — Movement split into two systems.** Drag-steering (world layer, no
path planning, axis-separated obstacle sliding) is separate from waypoint/BFS pathing
(need-bubble auto-walk only). Mixing them caused stutter in the Phase 0 spike
(path recomputed every pointer-move, fighting mid-step position).

**2026-08-13 — Art fallback pattern confirmed.** Objects/sprites check for a real
asset file first (e.g. `sprite.png`), silently fall back to code-drawn placeholder
if missing. Validated in Phase 0 spike; carries into Phase 1 as a hard requirement,
not a nice-to-have.

**2026-08-13 — Tile size ~25cm, provisional.** Held up at Phase 0 spike scale (single
mocked-up living room). Not yet validated against real measured room dimensions or
the new camera-follow zoom level (R1). Re-measure before finalizing room files.

**2026-08-14 — Build tooling is Vite + TypeScript; the engine itself stays plain
canvas.** Vite/TS is bundling and dev-server tooling only, not a game framework —
it doesn't touch the "plain canvas held up at spike scale" open question in
phase-1.md, which is still unresolved and revisited once multi-room + animated
sheets + mini-games are concurrent.

**2026-08-14 — `.room` files use YAML frontmatter for the header.** Delimited by
`---` lines, parsed with the same `yaml` package used for objects.yaml/stages.yaml,
so there's one parsing dependency instead of a bespoke header format. The grid
below the second `---` is untouched plain ASCII.

**2026-08-14 — Doors connect rooms without requiring geometric contiguity
on-screen.** R1 mandates hard-cut doorways with no parallax/camera drift, so
each room is authored and rendered independently; a door only needs a
consistent (target room, target spawn tile) pair, not real-world-adjacent
coordinates between the two rooms.

**2026-08-14 — Fixed spawn room is `living_room` (hub of the house graph).**
Encoded as `SPAWN_ROOM` in `src/engine/config.ts`, not derived from
stages.yaml's room ordering, so it can't silently change if that list is
reordered. Satisfies R2 "always spawn in the same room."

**2026-08-14 — First build pass covers world engine core + camera + house
replica + drag-steering (phase-1.md build-order items 1-5, movement half).**
BFS auto-walk (`src/movement/bfsPath.ts`) is implemented as a standalone pure
module but not wired to any trigger yet, since the need-bubble system that
would trigger it (R11-14) doesn't exist. Single avatar only — profile
switching (R6, build-order item 8) not yet built. Verified rendering,
footprint-derived walkability, and door transitions in a live browser run
(Playwright against `npm run dev`) with zero real art assets present and
zero console errors.

**2026-08-14 — Layered sprites use a 3-layer body/clothing/hair split, each
checked for its own asset independently.** `src/avatar/sprite.ts` resolves
asset paths per (avatarId, layer, pose, facing); each layer falls back to
its own code-drawn placeholder if missing, so a real `body.png` with no
matching `hair.png` still renders correctly — the art pipeline's
placeholder-fallback rule applies per layer, not just per avatar. Only
`idle`/`walk` poses exist so far; need-state poses wait on R11-14.

**2026-08-14 — Profile portraits (R6) are visual-only, no name text.**
CLAUDE.md's "no labels/instructional text" is a hard prohibition that
overrides everything else, including spec.md's R6 note about "real names."
Read that note as: any future copy elsewhere in the app should refer to the
child in third person by name, not as a mandate to print a name label under
a portrait. Portraits distinguish kids by their layered placeholder palette
(and later, real photo art) alone. Flagging this reading in case it's wrong
— it's a plausible but not certain resolution of a real tension between two
source docs.

**2026-08-14 — Parent NPCs (R7) reuse the objects.yaml anchor/footprint
system rather than a parallel `npcs:` room-header field.** `ObjectDef` gained
an optional `kind: 'npc'` discriminator; a parent is authored as a normal
single-char anchor (`P`) that blocks its tile like any other piece of
furniture. One generic "parent" type, placed at two authored positions
(living_room, kitchen) — nothing in phase-1.md calls for named/distinct
parents yet, so a second type wasn't built. Tapping a parent tile plays a
retriggerable bounce and consumes the pointer instead of starting
drag-steering underneath it, the same pattern R16 interactables will use.
No sound: audio approach (recorded voices vs. SFX) is still an open,
unresolved item in phase-1.md, so this stays visual-only until that's
decided.
